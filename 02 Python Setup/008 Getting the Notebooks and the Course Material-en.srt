00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,990
Everyone I just wanted to take this lecture to very quickly show you how you can download the course

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,490
notebooks and open them on your computer in case you're having any issues with that.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,400
If you've already been able to do that just from the links from the FNQ lecture or the Course overview

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,590
lecture feel free to skip this lecture.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,870
But basically all I'm going to do here is show you how you can actually download the notes from our

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,090
page.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,570
So you should have seen a little blue pop up with a resource link and that resource link will take you

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,010
to the page for a period data and the complete Python 3 bootcamp.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,260
So go to this resource link.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,310
You can either type it in manually Google search it or just use the little blue pop up that happens

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,510
when you're watching this lecture.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,310
So let's hop over to that link.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,040
OK so here we are at that hub repository and this is basically an online repository that you can access

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,960
in order to get the actual course notes you'll see here how the course notes are organized.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,700
We basically have it numbered off by section and then inside of the sections you'll see the notebooks

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:06,150
themselves and the notebooks are titled both so that their lecturer title matches as best we could with

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,180
the note book title.

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,500
And then we also have them kind of numbered so you can go through them in order.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,610
So for example when you're learning about four loops you go ahead and click here on four loops and this

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,310
will eventually load up the notebook and notice how it's a IPY and B file but once you have the notebook

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,870
loaded you should see lots of useful information here.

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,020
And then the actual code itself.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,800
Now if you want to run these notebooks onto your computer where you need to do is download this repository.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,110
So we'll come back here click and complete Python 3 bootcamp and there's different ways you can download

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,920
this repository.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,130
If you're already familiar get you can feel free to form this repository and then have it on your own

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,850
home.

28
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,170
Keep in mind we are constantly updating this but we can do also to just get the files locally.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,790
Click here where it says clone or download and then click on downloads zip and that will download a

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,460
zip file that you can then unzip and that will have all the IPY and be files that you can then access

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,530
using your anaconda navigator.

32
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,130
As we showed in the running Python code lecture.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,520
All right.

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,840
That's just a very quick overview of how to get the notes.

35
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,040
If you ever have any questions on this feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums but definitely check out the

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,060
fakie lecture where we have more detailed instructions on how to do all this.

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,230
OK thanks everyone.

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,370
We'll see you at the next lecture.
