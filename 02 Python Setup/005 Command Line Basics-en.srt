00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,260
Hey everyone welcome to this crash course lecture on using your command line.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,330
Before we install anything including python it's actually really important to have a very quick overview

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,580
of how to work your command line and the command line basically allows you to programmatically move

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,480
through your computer's directories.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,800
That way you can run Python scripts at your command line.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,970
We're going to cover in this short lecture is how to find your current directory how to list all the

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,050
files in at the rectory how to change the directory and how to clear the command line screen.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,170
Something you need to understand though is that the commands are going to be slightly different depending

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,030
on what your operating system is.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,700
So for Mac OS and Linux users go ahead and jump to this time in the video in order to go through your

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,270
instructions if you're a Windows user go ahead and jump to this time stamp at the video to jump to your

12
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,420
specific instructions.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,690
And then once you've gone through your command line crash course go ahead and move on to the next lecture.

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,030
Again this is just because the commands are slightly different for Linux and Mac OS users versus Windows

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,990
users.

16
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,330
OK.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,380
Go ahead and jump to the correct time stamp and we'll meet back there.

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,740
All right.

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,460
So let's go over the windows command line operations at your computer to find the command prompt.

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,200
All you need to do is search for the term CMD.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,880
And we should be able to find command prompt as the best match if command prompt doesn't show up when

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,000
you search CMD.

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,200
Instead just search for the whole phrase command prompt and then you should see command prompt.

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,240
Desktop app.

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,910
Once you've opened up your command prompt you should see something that looks like this.

26
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,680
Let's start off by finding out where are we currently located.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,260
Basically what's our current directory.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,640
I can use the command line to interact on my computer but to actually perform those interactions I need

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,250
to know where I am at on my computer.

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,200
You can think of this as basically programmatically moving around through files and folders on your

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,520
computer.

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,730
You can type out CD enter and this will report back your current directory.

33
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,870
Now you'll notice the command prompt actually basically gives you the file path over you already are.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,630
But sometimes it's a file path is really long or you're dealing with more complex things like virtual

35
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,570
environments or installations.

36
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,130
It's always a good idea to check your current directory by typing CD.

37
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,100
Sometimes things like the Anaconda prompt will have other directories in parentheses.

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,390
You can always confirm your current directory by typing a CD enter and that reports back where you are.

39
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,530
So I can see right now I'm under this particular user's folder.

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,600
If I wanted to figure out where all the files and folders located in my current directory were or are

41
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,200
I can type.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,970
D i r.

43
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,810
Hit enter.

44
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,290
And that reports back the contents of my directory.

45
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,660
I can see here that there is a desktop documents downloads as well as some hidden files denoted by starting

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,280
with a dot.

47
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,600
But basically this is everything that's in this folder.

48
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,920
See users Marcio I can scroll down CCSB files pictures.

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Now lets imagine I wanted to actually move into one of these sub folders.

50
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,850
What I can do is type CD and then the name of that folder.

51
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,960
For example if I wanted to change directories to my desktop location I could type CD change directory

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:31,010
space and the desktop hit enter and now I'm at my desktop and I can type CD to confirm that I'm at my

53
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,600
desktop if I want to go back up that victory.

54
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:42,800
All I need to do is type see the space dot dot or period period to enter and I've moved back up a directory.

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,190
Now you don't actually need to type in the entire file path.

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:54,210
If you're moving around what you can do say CD begin typing such as the letter D then hit tab.

57
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,750
You should be able to see autocomplete for you.

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,790
So as I hit tab I get the various options of everything that starts with a capital D so I can go to

59
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,870
documents enter and then if I wanted to see all my documents I can type d r.

60
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,970
Now we can see all our documents here.

61
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,380
Again if I want to go back see the space thought and if I ever want to clear my entire command line

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,500
screen I can type CLX and I've cleared the entire screen.

63
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:20,910
All right.

64
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,450
That's really all the basics we need to know for right now.

65
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:32,120
Just to review CD for current directory Diyar to list everything in my directory CD and then the name

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,410
of the folder that I want to jump to.

67
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,220
For example if I want to go to downloads CD downloads again you can hit tab to autocomplete And if we

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,060
ever want to jump back up CD.

69
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,970
But if we ever want to clear the screen it's seamless.

70
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,310
That's the basics you need to know.

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,520
We'll see you at the next lesson where we discuss how to install Python.

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,280
All right so let's go over the Mac OS and Linux command line operations and your command line in Mac

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,130
OS and Linux is known as a terminal.

74
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,570
So these commands work on both of these operating systems the exact same way.

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,050
Let's get started is to begin working of the command line on a Linux or Mac OS.

76
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,160
You first need to open up your terminal search your computer for terminal your Mac OS or Linux.

77
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,470
It's called the same thing and then open up your terminal.

78
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,500
You should eventually get something that looks like this.

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,600
The colors or fonts may be slightly different but the basic idea is the same.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,450
The terminal gives you a command line interface and the command line interface allows you to move around

81
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,040
different files or folders on your computer and with some more advanced functionality you can also make

82
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,170
new directories or remove directories.

83
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,950
We don't really need to know that right now.

84
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:46,180
All we really need to know is how to understand what our current working directory is changed directories

85
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,770
and just move around.

86
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,660
This basically allows us to move around the computer at the command line.

87
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:58,960
The first thing we want to know is where we're currently located to know that type PWT enter and this

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,940
will print your working directory.

89
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,140
This is where you're currently located at the command line if you want to understand what files and

90
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,820
folders are located at your current location type L S and then enter and you should see a list of different

91
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,970
files and folders at your current directory.

92
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:27,390
If you ever want to move to one of those files or folders where you can do is type CD and then whichever

93
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,660
file or folder you want to go to however it should be in the list that was just printed.

94
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:42,130
For example let's move to our desktop so I will come back down here and type see the desktop enter.

95
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,980
And now if I type PWT I hit enter again I'm now at my desktop.

96
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,340
If you ever want to clear your screen just type clear enter and now you've been able to clear your command

97
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,630
line.

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,360
If you ever want to go back up a victory it should see the space thought hit enter and now we're back

99
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,800
up a directory which I can confirm by typing P.W..

100
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,260
That's really all we need to know.

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,060
As far as the commands are concerned let's have a quick review to print your working directory.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,210
It's PWT and this report's back.

103
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,000
We are currently located.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,090
If you want to know the files and folders at your current location.

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,630
Type ls and this will list all the files and folders if you want to clear your command screen type clear

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,440
enter.

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,610
This will clear your command line if you want to change directory to a subfolder type CD and then you

108
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,620
can even begin typing the names such as desktop.

109
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,800
And if I just desk and then hit tab it should auto complete.

110
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,300
If you do not get an autocomplete by hitting tab that's probably a good indicator that it's not a direct

111
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,510
subfolder of your current directory but then you can type CD.

112
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,720
The name of the subfolder are subdirectory and then we can see now we're located here by taping PWT.

113
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,850
If you ever want to go back up type CD space thought OK that's the basics of moving around through the

114
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,770
command line.

115
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,970
We're going to be using that later on when we run Python scripts at the command line.

116
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,600
We'll see you at the next lesson where we discuss how to actually install Python onto your computer.
