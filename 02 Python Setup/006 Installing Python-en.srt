00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,370
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,350
We're going to briefly discuss Python and its advantages in an overview and then we'll show you how

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,260
to install Python on your computer.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,780
Now Python was developed in 1991 by Van Rossum and it's quickly become one of the most popular programming

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,370
languages in the world.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,100
And this is because it has many advantages.

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,610
The main advantage is that Python has is that developers can learn it quickly and this is because it

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,720
typically involves a lot less code than other languages and the syntax is a lot easier to read.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,670
And this is because as you'll learn later on is that Python makes use of whitespace.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,890
That is a uses indentation instead of curly braces and that allows users to really learn it a lot faster

11
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,580
than they would.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,410
Other programming languages.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,900
And because of that Python is now utilized by pretty much every major technology company in some capacity.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,280
And what's also really nice about Python is that there's a huge amount of additional open source libraries

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,580
then that's basically to say if you want to perform a particular task in Python maybe you want to create

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:14,120
PTF in Python send an email in Python work with images data analysis create a web site.

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,340
There's additional frameworks and libraries available to you that are open source that people have created

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,530
that allow you to do those things.

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,990
Python itself has a lot of stuff built in.

20
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,620
It's known as a programming language that has batteries included.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,000
And that's because there's a lot of standard libraries that are included in Python that allow you to

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,750
already do a lot of stuff that is to say for instance it has a math library that has a lot of capability

23
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,460
but there are additional libraries in case you need to focus more on a particular niche topic such as

24
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,650
numerical computing.

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,410
There's a library called Num. Peiffer that so to actually look at all these advantages and start learning

26
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,870
Python We need to install it and we're going to install Python using the free Anaconda distribution.

27
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,280
And the reason for that is that this distribution includes Python as well as many other useful libraries

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,810
including Jupiter which is the notebook system.

29
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,080
We're going to be using throughout the course later on we'll use things like text editors to write Python

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,680
scripts.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,600
But when we first start learning and Jupiter is a great choice now Anaconda another reason we choose

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,150
it is that it can be easily installed onto any major operating system such as when those Mac OS or Linux.

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,630
One thing I do want to point out before we jump to the actual Anaconda download web site is that because

34
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,690
Anaconda includes a lot of these other libraries there's also a miniature version of Anaconda which

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,370
has many Khanda which is a lot smaller suffocation or have enough room on your computer for the full

36
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,420
and a constellation.

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,280
There's also many Khanda and we'll be showing you how to work with that right after we show you the

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,450
main Anaconda setup.

39
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,950
So it is recommended that you use the full Anaconda but just in case you don't have a fast internet

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,160
connection or you don't have enough space on your computer you can always use mini Mini-Con.

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,900
So this began the installation process by going to w w w and Colorado com slash downloads.

42
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,390
I'll see you there.

43
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,110
So Anaconda dot com slash download the Web site will look something similar to this.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,760
It may be updated from time to time as far as the look and feel but in general it will have the download

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,290
links for the various installers for the Windows Mac OS and Linux systems.

46
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,230
And if you click on one of these you'll be brought down to the actual download links for the graphical

47
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,510
installers or the command line installers.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,650
By the time you view this page it's most likely that 3.7 or 3.8 or even 3.9 has been released.

49
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,950
So keep that in mind.

50
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,440
Any version of Python 3 should be fine for our use cases.

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Now if you're on Windows you'll go ahead and download the graphical installer 64 bit or 32 bit depending

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,100
on your computer.

53
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,660
Most newer computers are going to be 64 bit and if you have any questions on that you can click to learn

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,260
more.

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,000
But basically this is just a graphical installer so wizard that's going to walk you step by step on

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,700
the installation process.

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,640
So for Windows users click on this graphical installer download it.

58
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,310
If you're on Mac OS click on this graphical installer and download it and then if you're on Linux you'll

59
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,330
be clicking on this installer and downloading it.

60
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,480
Keep in mind that Linux users have a command line installer and you'll have to type commands that will

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
show you in just a second.

62
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,490
Once you've decided which version you're going to download.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,200
Scroll down a little bit and click HERE where it says how to install Anaconda and the pending on what

64
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,060
operating system you're currently on.

65
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,340
It will take you to one of these three pages here you can see installing on Windows and it has step

66
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,830
by step instructions for installing the graphical installers are really quite straightforward.

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
You just select the defaults hit next and follow along with these.

68
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,030
Step by step instructions.

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,760
You don't need to worry about number 2 as far as verifying the data integrity.

70
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,260
If you're on a Mac OS it's basically the same thing if you click on that link on how to install it will

71
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,220
guide you through the graphical installation process for Mac OS.

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,170
Again step by step process.

73
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,100
Pretty straightforward.

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,560
Just hit continue on all the screens.

75
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,500
If you're on Linux it's going to be slightly different.

76
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:10,090
What you need to do is you'll be downloading a s h file and then at your command line or a terminal

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:17,990
you'll be running the following command bash and then right here down tilde downloads and the three

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,870
and then whatever version you happen to be clicking on.

79
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,440
Basically just copy and paste this command into your terminal.

80
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,220
A quick note for Windows users and this is a pretty important one.

81
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,370
You'll eventually have a screen that looks like this saying advanced installation options and you can

82
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,010
choose whether or not you want to add anaconda to your path environment variable and call themselves

83
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,180
recommends to not add Anaconda as a path environment variable.

84
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,010
Since this can interfere with other software typically what it's going to interfere with is previous

85
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,710
downloads of Python.

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,940
However since this is probably your first download of python we actually highly recommend that you do

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,210
add anaconda to your path environment variable.

88
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,250
This will allow you to call Konda specific commands directly at your command line.

89
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,130
Again for Windows users we do recommend the add anaconda to your path environment variable.

90
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,520
When you click on it you'll notice that it says not recommended.

91
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,710
It'll highlight in red.

92
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,810
Go ahead and click on it anyways and then install.

93
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,750
Now as we previously mentioned these graphical installation files include Anaconda Python and many other

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,580
libraries in this distribution so you'll notice that it's actually quite a large file.

95
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,690
About half a gigabyte depending on your internet connection or the space available on your computer.

96
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,020
You may not want to actually download install all these libraries.

97
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,170
Instead you probably just want the basics of Python for that use case.

98
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,300
You can look for conduct that I O slash Mini-Con the dash 8 T.M. or just google search for many Khanda

99
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,940
and it will take you to the Mini-Con the links for the installers and it's basically the exact same

100
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,070
thing except it's a much smaller file and it does include a variety of the libraries which you don't

101
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,380
really need to worry about.

102
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,170
So there's one for Windows Mac OS and Linux surfer interested in a much smaller file download.

103
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,440
You can use those installers as well.

104
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,720
However we do recommend that if you have the bandwidth and the space that you just download the full

105
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,610
Anaconda installation.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,440
Once you've successfully downloaded and gone through the installation steps for Anaconda you should

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,460
be able to search your computer for Anaconda navigator.

108
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,870
This is a desktop app that allows you to quickly launch duper notebooks.

109
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,530
So go ahead and confirm your installation by clicking on Anaconda Navigator.

110
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,560
It will load up and eventually you'll see something that looks like this with little quick dashboards

111
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,850
that allow you to launch different development environments.

112
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,990
There's that Jupiter notebook R-Maine development environment.

113
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,260
There's the cootie cons..

114
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,840
Spider in other integrated development environment.

115
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,350
There's also other things like glue.

116
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,570
Is Jupiter lab.

117
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,030
And even aren't our studio.

118
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,080
If you decide to later on learn are you can install it as well as a click of a button.

119
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,130
So we're going to be using the Neukom navigator to quickly launch Jupiter notebooks.

120
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,810
So now that we have Anaconda and Python installed on your computer you should be able to open up the

121
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,810
Anaconda navigator.

122
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:17,180
Up next we'll discuss how to actually run Python code either as a script at the command line or using

123
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,130
the Jupiter notebook.
