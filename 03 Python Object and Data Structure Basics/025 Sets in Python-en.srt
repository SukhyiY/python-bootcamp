Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,820
We're going to very quickly cover what sets are and sets are an ordered collections of unique elements

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,320
and this basically means that there can only be one representative of the same object so you can't have

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,800
the number two in there more than one time or the letter A in there more than one time.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,480
Let's see some examples of how to work with sets in the Jupiter notebook to begin let's create a set.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,200
We can do that by saying my set or the variable name you want is equal to set and then open and close

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,460
parentheses.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,360
So right now we have my set and it's just an empty set.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,970
So it returns back set.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,330
I actually want to add an object to the set.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,350
I can say my set and then call the add method and we can add one object to this.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,610
So it's the number one.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,850
Now if I take a look at my set I see it has the number one there.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,440
Now notice it looks like it's a dictionary because this curly braces but it's not because it doesn't

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,090
have a key value pairs.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,230
It's just unordered collections of the items you want.

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,730
So it's an other object here.

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,250
I will say my set add in the number two.

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:20,290
And then if I call my set again flips I call it my set I get 1 and 2 there.

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,590
Now try adding 2 a second time and see what happens.

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:33,710
I call my set is still just shows 1 and 2 it doesn't show 1 2 2 and this is basically what it is.

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,300
It has to be unique values in there.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,060
If you try to add a value that's already in the set.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,130
It won't repeat it.

25
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,370
Ill just say hey we already have that value in there.

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,440
I only accept unique values.

27
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,140
So when you're working two sets it may not be super useful to add them in this manner.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,630
Instead what it's really useful for is maybe casting a list to a set that we only get the unique values.

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,900
So for instance we'll say my list is equal to and I'm going to place a bunch of repeated values in here

30
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,240
a bunch of ones a bunch of twos and a bunch of threes.

31
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm going to run this and then I'm going to cast this as a set.

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,910
And now I get back only a set of unique values.

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,100
Keep in mind sets don't technically have an order to them since we're dealing very small sets here of

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,440
just a few items.

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,720
It looks like they have an order but in reality sets don't have any particular order to go in.

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,830
For now that's all you need to know about sets.

37
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,110
We won't really touch upon this object or data type again until much later in the course since we're

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,960
just beginning.

39
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,630
It won't be very useful to us now but later on we'll be able to see different use cases for it.

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,960
Again remember just that sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

41
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,840
Thanks and we'll see at the next lecture where we discuss billion's.
